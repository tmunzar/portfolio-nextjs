                  Why make a filmmaking learning platform in the first place?

                <p>
                  Our clients who had experience working in the film industry
                  presented us with the thesis that the film industry lacks a
                  certification program, unlike other industries such as law,
                  accounting or medicine. What would precede a certification is
                  a learning program, and the best way to deliver teachable
                  content these days is online.

                  To get started, we conducted some background research via
                  semi-structured interviews with established industry
                  professionals that our client was kind enough to connect us
                  to. One of them was Eduardo Sanchez, the director of the Blair

                <p>
                  The purpose of this research was to immerse ourselves in the
                  workings of the film industry before we set out to research
                  and design a learning platform catered to it.

                  We decided it best to do our Lo-Fi prototypes using Paper
                  prototypes, so that we could make changes to our designs on
                  the fly while user-testing.

                <p>
                  Once we validated our design via the lo-fi prototype testing,
                  we set out to make a final high fidelity design and produce an
                  interactive online prototype as part of the final deliverables
                  of the project. Below is a preview. You can also view the
